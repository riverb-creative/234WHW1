> Security Best-Practices Demonstrated
   > * Environment variables for secrets used for JSON Web Token and Mongo DB Atlas
   > * Using Helmet middleware to set security-related HTTP response headers
   > * Input validation used on router of apiUsers (add user, & edit user) and apiBooks (delete book)
   > * The use of proper HTTP status codes: 200, 201, 400, 401, 409, & 500
   > * Avoiding the inclusion of sensitive data in responses: passwords not shown in responses

> Protected Routes:
   > * apiBooks route is protected by using the jsonwebtoken, so only authorized users can delete a book by its Book ID
   > * Both apiBooks and apiUsers routes are protected with express-validator dependencies with the _.escape()_ option in order to sanitize any text that has HTML mark up characters.
